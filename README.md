Euchre
======

This is an implementation of the card game Euchre. The player plays against 3 computer players. Many, but not all of the rules are implemented. Functionally the game works the same, however there are many things that you can or cannot do which differ from the real game.

The computer players will do their best to make reasonable decisions, however their decision logic is not overly complicated. If you are looking to play a proper game of Euchre, these aren't the cards you're looking for.
